        <p>
          My dream job is to become a software engineer. Build software that can help humanities to cope up with service gaps that can be easily solved by machines. I also love solving problems, logic, and writing code that's why I take BSIT.

        <p class="mb-0">
          I also want to build a software development company that hires students with talents in coding and give them scholarships. After that, I want to become a professor and take master's and doctor's degree, teach students with real-life experience and examples in the IT industry.
